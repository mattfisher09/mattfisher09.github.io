                    Here, I have worked as a Sales Associate. This job has meant 
                    that I have received a lot of training in things such as operating a till, working RFID systems and a lot of customer service training. 
                    In this job, it is important to be keen to help customers and have the right attitude and techniques in order to sell products. 
                    Through the recent pandemic, this job has given me a lot of training on how to maintain a safe but efficient store environment

                    how to deal with unsatisfied customers, and learnt valuable skills in sales that I could transfer to other roles, as this was provided

                        It has given me experience creating SEO optimised content for a tour company, and it has been interesting to learn Google Analytics as well, which can be used to compare how the site is ranking/performing compared to competitors.
                        They're website runs on Wordpress, and I have gained a lot of experience creating new tour pages, as well as pages for about us content, employment etc.

                        This is another tour company in Alaska, this one specifies in Helicopter tours. The work for this company is a similar process for Snowhook, although a bit more design based. 
                        A lot of experience in locational SEO has been obtained through this client. I've worked on a range of pages on this site ranging from tours, charters and the 'Helicopter rides near me' page.

                        Royal Flush is a plumbing business, so the website is a lot more corporate and commercial compared to the previous 2 clients. This has meant different approaches to SEO and web design. 
                        I have worked on many pages on this site, such as the service pages and faqs. I have also performed benchmarking on this site, to track how well our services are doing for the site. All good experience.

                        Royal Flush Porta Potty is a sister company to Royal Flush Septic. The site is currently in very early days. Working on this site from the start has meant I have good experience in designing and building a website from scratch,
                         and the associated processes that come with it. My work on this site again revolves around designing, developing and writing optimised content.

                        Advatec is a new project for me, and involves both a b2b and b2c site. Their B2C site uses shopify, which is good experience and slightly different to working with the sites that are on Wordpress.
                        Through this project, as it is in the very early stages, I have been involved in meeting the clients and sitting in on business consultancy meetings, which is great experience. Working with a business who's focus is on selling 
                        products is different to the tour companies and commerical sites and offers new challenges. The project is still very early in development and a website overhaul, as well as an SEO plan is currently underway.

                        this project was really good for learning css grid and flexbox.

                        This is a game I made designed for kids using css transitions, html and javascript/jquery. I designed all of the illustrations myself. This module was a great opportunity to go deeper into css transitons and the basics of JavaScript, which in turn
                        has helped me develop better websites. I designed all of the illustrations using Illustrator and Photoshop, showing that I am confident in Adobe Software.

                    <p class="standard-body-text">
                        This is my most recent hand in for web, the Leeds Discovered website. This site was first coded in static html and css, including things like transitions (picked up from previous modules). The main difference in this assignment was the use of a framework,
                        Bootstrap. Learning this framework has improved coding efficiency for me and helped me create better looking sites. After the static site was complete, I then made it dynamic using PhP and Wordpress. This involved creating my own theme and using plug-ins
                        such as ACF to create an efficient, dynamic website, which would make creating new pages or uploading new events easier.
